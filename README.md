## Part 1 ‚Äì Automation

### API Under Test

**Endpoint:**  
`https://web-cdn.api.bbci.co.uk/wc-poll-data/container/sportstandings?urn=urn:bbc:sportsdata:rugby-union:tournament:six-nations`

This endpoint provides current standings for the Six Nations Rugby Union competition.

### Automated Test Scenarios Implemented

1. **Status Code & Response Time Check**

   - GET request returns `200 OK`
   - Response time is under `1000ms`

2. **Data Validation**

   - Each `id` field is non-null and non-empty
   - `participants` array contains exactly 6 items

3. **Alternate Competition Check**

   - A different competition name returns corresponding data

4. **Invalid Competition Handling**

   - Invalid name returns a `404` with an error message

5. **Header Stripping Verification**
   - Confirms the custom header `x-test-harness=true` is not echoed in the response
